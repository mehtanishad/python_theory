Without software, most computers would be useless. The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages due to the language being closer to natural human language as opposed to machine language. The high-level language is then translated into low-level machine code using a compiler or interpreter for the computer to understand. Software can also be written in a low-level assembly language, but it is less common."],"metadata":{"id":"DijMzYnqp8O1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" # What are the types of Applications?\n","\n","1) Web Applications\n","2) Desktop GUI Applications\n","3) Console-based Application\n","4) Software Development\n","5) Scientific and Numeric\n","6) Business Applications\n","7) Audio or Video-based Applications\n","8) 3D CAD Applications"],"metadata":{"id":"pXxknkw2kBRh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# What is programing? \n","\n","“Programming is how you get computers to solve problems.”\n"," Computer programming is a fundamental skill for so many different applications, not just software development or cutting-edge research into artificial intelligence.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"SDInCleBmFAM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# What is Python?\n","\n","Python is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language.
